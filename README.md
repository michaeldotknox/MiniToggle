# MiniToggle
A feature toggle library

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/nryn2sx789mx1k07?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/michaeldotknox/minitoggle)


MiniToggle is a feature toggle library using what I consider to be the best implementations of the various feature toggle libraries I have come across.  Consider this to be a very early beta version, so things are changing as I go.

More documentation will come soon as I solidify features and functionality.
