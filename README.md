# MiniToggle
A feature toggle library

MiniToggle is a feature toggle library using what I consider to be the best implementations of the various feature toggle libraries I have come across.  Consider this to be a very early beta version, so things are changing as I go.

More documentation will come soon as I solidify features and functionality.
